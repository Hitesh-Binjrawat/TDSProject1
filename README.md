- I have scrapped data using python request and created personal token from git hub account to increase query request per hour. First i gathered all the users and then their's latest 500 hundrered repositories.
- The most interesting thing about data is that my watchers count was equal to stargazers count in almost  all enteries suggesting whoever watches the repositiers also stars it
- I would recommend to developers to focus on creating good repositories.
